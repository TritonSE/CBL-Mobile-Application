# call_black_line

Call BlackLine is a nonprofit organization that operates a hotline for people to call or text for support with crisis counseling, to report negative interactions with the police, and to be a referral source for Black, Brown, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). The organization works to decrease the stigma around mental health in communities of color. This application aims to centralize the nonprofit organization's resources and allow all users a space to communicate their testimonials through the method of communication that they choose.
